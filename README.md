# Capstone Project: Restaurant Application 

The Restaurant Application is a full-stack web application developed as part of the MIT MERN Full Stack coding certification. It aims to provide users with a seamless experience for browsing and ordering food items from a restaurant's menu.

## The application is built using the following technologies:

-  Front-end architecture: Next.js
-  Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
-  Database: PostgreSQL
-  API: Strapi (Headless CMS)
-  Deployment: Vercel (Front-end), Render (Back-end)

## Features

-  User authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and log out. Authentication is implemented using JWT for secure and persistent user sessions.
-  Menu browsing: Users can view the restaurant menu, including food item details such as name, description, and price.
-  Cart management: Users can add items to their cart, modify quantities, and remove items.
-  Order placement: Users can place an order and receive a confirmation with order details.



### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database
- Strapi CMS (installed and configured)
  
# FRONT-END

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
